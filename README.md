Do you know about an existing dataset or a (large) set of raw documents with textual data? Do not hesitate to contribute to the SwissAI data catalogue. It is as simple as opening an [issue](https://github.com/impresso/test-catalogue/issues/new/choose).

We invite you to contribute two types of data record:

- A source record [[Issue Template for Source Record]()], i.e. a set of raw documents containing textual data that is far from being a processable dataset.  

- A dataset record: [[Issue Template for Dataset Record]()]
